# AdventOfCode2020
Doing the 2020 advent of code in C++ as a refresher of the syntax and some libraries. My C++ code is horrifically rusty and this will be riddled with bad practices and magic numbers... You've been warned. Continue at your own risk.

## Closing update

Throughout the 25 days of puzzles, I feel my C++ knowledge and code has steadily increased in standard. 
Although I'm sad there was no excuses to play with the new pointer functionality, I am very happy I stuck with C++ as my language of choice for this. The first few days especially show how out of touch and rusty I was with the language. The syntax is now firmly burned back into my memory.
It was a fun experience and one I'm glad I seen through to the end, despite hitting areas of burn out throughout the puzzles.

Should I ever run out of personal projects (like that has ever happened to anyone!), then I'd like to come back to this repo and try optimise some solutions. For now though, I hope you find some interesting approaches in here and have a great day and new year! See you in 2021 where we go again. 

### Warnings

Although I feel I've achieved good results on the majority of puzzles, I want to leave a warning here for anyone wanting to run these later on.
First: Please use the Release version of C++ to run the puzzles, it will speed up your day massively on the slower solutions!
Second: If you can avoid running number 22, do it! Unless you want to go and get a coffee in the wait time - as it's by far the least optimal solution (note-worthy contenders are days 7, 15, 19 and 23).
