# Day 16
The code here is particularly muddled up. It was a late night start for this one, and I think it shows in how messy the code ended up.
No idea how why it works so fast since I didn't optimise anything at all... So uh. That's a thing. 

I once again apologise for the disaster you're about to see from a very sleepy brain.
