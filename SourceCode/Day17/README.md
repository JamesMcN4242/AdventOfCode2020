# Day 17
Do you ever start writing code at 23:38 and think... "Why am I doing this to myself and/or others?"
That's me every day of advent of code this week since I've not had the time to study or try different solutions if I want to sleep at all.

I am a strong believer that for loops should never really (there will obviously be exceptions) reach k in the i,j,k iterator naming... H/L I've never reached before this day and I can only imagine future me is crying looking at this.
If anyone from my works see this: Please don't fire me. Knowing the sins I've committed in these files is enough punishment.
But also, I'm really tired at this point, realise I've gone down the 'wrong' solution but am also stubborn that I want to finish at least one more day before burning out, and know if I try to change at this point I'll just give up for 2020.
So forgive me for this crime. 

P.S. I seem to ramble and write down my thoughts a lot more the sleepier I get. Never noticed that one before. 
P.P.S. Never once have I actually known what "P.S." stands for, and at this point I'm too scared to ask. 
P.P.P.S. I'm really confused why this is running so 'fast' in release versions. I know I've used the cache lines in my loop iterations for each subsequent deque... But it's still unoptimised cowbow code thrown together here.
P.P.P.P.S. This should further prove the first P.S. I'm going to go sleep now. Sorry again for what you may witness in this day's solution
